= Entity Log

Entity Log is a mechanism for tracking changes in your JPA entities. It records changes in entity attributes and provides a user interface for searching and displaying information about the changes:

* What entity instance was changed.
* Old and new values of changed attributes.
* When the entity was changed.
* Which user changed the entity.

== Registering Changes

Entity Log automatically tracks changes of JPA entities when they are saved using xref:data-access:data-manager.adoc[DataManager]. It doesn't work if you use xref:data-access:entity-manager.adoc[EntityManager] or native SQL.

You can also use the `EntityLog` bean to register changed entities from your application code. In this case, invoke `registerCreate()`, `registerModify()` and `registerDelete()` methods with `auto` parameter set to false. When the entity log is called automatically by the framework, this parameter is set to true.

== Setting Up Entity Log

You can set up entity log in the *Administration -> Entity Log* application screen.

Also, you can set up entity log by entering some records in the database if you want to include the configuration to the database initialization.

Logging is configured using the `LoggedEntity` and `LoggedAttribute` entities corresponding to `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

`LoggedEntity` defines the types of entities that should be logged. `LoggedEntity` has the following attributes:

* `name` – the name of the entity meta-class, for example, `sample_Order`.
* `auto` – defines if the system should log the changes when `EntityLog` is called with `auto` = `true` parameter (called by entity listeners).
* `manual` – defines if the system should log the changes when `EntityLog` is called with auto = `false` parameter.

`LoggedAttribute` defines the entity attribute to be logged and contains a link to the `LoggedEntity` and the attribute name.

To set up logging for a certain entity, add the corresponding entries into the `AUDIT_LOGGED_ENTITY` and `AUDIT_LOGGED_ATTR` tables.

In the example, logging changes of the `phone` attribute of the `Customer` entity is set up while database initialization:

[source,xml,indent=0]

== Viewing Entity Log

To view the entity log content, go to the *Administration -> Entity Log* screen. Set necessary filters to find log entries.

Also, you can access the log for a certain entity from any application screen.

Log entries are stored in the `AUDIT_ENTITY_LOG` table corresponding to the `EntityLogItem` entity. Changed attribute values are stored in the `CHANGES` column and are converted to instances of `EntityLogAttr` entity.

In the example below, an edit screen for the `Order` entity shows tables with the entity log content.

Here is a fragment of the screen XML descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/resources/audit/ex1/screen/order/order-edit.xml[tags=order-xml]
----

<1> Loading a collection of `EntityLogItem` into the `entityLogItemsDc` data container.
<2> Loading associated `EntityLogAttr` instances into the `entityLogAttrDc` data container.
<3> A table connected to the `entityLogItemsDc` container.
<4> A table connected to the `entityLogAttrDc` container.

`Order` screen controller looks like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$/ex1/src/main/java/audit/ex1/screen/order/OrderEdit.java[tags=order-java]
----

<1> The `onBeforeShow` method loads data before showing the screen.
<2> In the `ItemChangeEvent` handler of the `orderDc` container, a parameter is set to the dependent loader and it is triggered.
